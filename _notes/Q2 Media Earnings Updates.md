### Insights & Themes

**The future of TV will be streamed.**
- Pandemic viewing behavior is here to stay. Worldwide TV streaming usage was up +13% in Q2 (source: Conviva). In June 2021, two-thirds of pay TV subs said they watched free VOD included with their subscription at least once a week, up from fewer than half in February 2020, according to Hub Entertainment Research report “Predicting the Pandemic.”
- Primetime ratings for the Tokyo Olympic Games were down 42% from the 2016 Games. Cord-cutting, the 13-hour time difference and a difficult-to-follow schedule between Peacock and linear TV contributed to the low viewership. However, streaming behavior was **up** with 5.5 billion streaming minutes.
- U.S. time spent watching advertising-supported video on demand (AVOD) increased 200% YoY from May 2020 to May 2021 ([TVision](https://www.tvisioninsights.com/resources/avod-increases-200-tvision-reports?utm_source=Triggermail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=eM%20briefing%20June%2028&utm_term=BII%20List%20DMedia%20ALL)). Time spent watching SVOD increased 100% whereas linear TV decreased 13% during same time period.
- More than 85% of kids ages 2-12 use YouTube, and 70% remember seeing advertising on it (source: [Precise TV](https://content.precise.tv/kids-usa)). After YouTube, 21% of kids used Nickelodeon to access online content, followed by Cartoon Network (21%) and Nick Jr (14%).
- The line between ads and content continues to blur, with WarnerMedia, NBCU and Roku offering capabilities to develop brand-sponsored custom content for advertisers. **WarnerMedia** is launching a new content studio called “House of Max,” which will develop custom creative for HBO Max’s ad-supported tier (featuring popular characters from its HBO Max shows). **NBCUniversal’s** branded content studio focuses more on creating content that functions like commercials. In July, NBCU [launched](https://www.campaignlive.com/article/nbcuniversal-invites-brands-co-create-content/1721508?utm_source=Triggermail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=eM%20briefing%20Aug%205&utm_term=BII%20List%20DMedia%20ALL) four new series that invited brands to co-create content to run across all its properties. Roku’s branded content studio creates everything from video ads on behalf of brands to brand-sponsored TV shows. “Roku Recommends” is a weekly, 15-minute show surfacing top titles to stream across the thousands of channels on Roku, and is featured on The Roku Channel. The show includes 2 minutes of standard ad programming and native, host-read ads similar to those found in podcasts, as well as sponsored segments, with Walmart on board as the show’s debut sponsor.
