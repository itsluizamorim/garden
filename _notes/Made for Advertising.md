That's an interesting topic. The cookie ecosystem (still around but not for much longer) puts quality brand ads on the long tail of small sites, but also on worthless or clickbait sites. This seems to be a well- known problem for Advertisers that no one wants to touch, given the revenue stream that it generates annually. While media companies, such as Xandr, focus on revenue streams over customer experience, these websites will keep afloat.

- **“Made for advertising”** sites, which flourish via platforms like Taboola and Outbrain, basically exist to grab ad dollars.
- Using content recommendation platforms like Taboola or Outbrain, these publishers place ads on legitimate news sources like USA Today, goading people with patently ridiculous headlines to click through to their sites.
- While browsing some of these clickbait sites, which have names like Adventure Crunch and It’s The Vibe, Marketing Brew found ads for Nike, CVS, Disney, JetBlue, Best Buy, and other blue-chip brands.
- This type of inventory is snapping up as much as 12.3% of global programmatic web display ad spend, according to Jounce Media, which reviewed spending on more than 2,000 sites it labeled as “made for advertising.”
- The ecosystem of spray-and-pray programmatic advertising may result in billions of dollars directed away from publishers that offer more traditionally vetted news toward a Wild West of crap content.
	- “It checks all the boxes that the industry cares about. It’s not fraud, it’s brand safe. It’s viewable, and it’s cheap.”
- Sites like The Magellan Times sustain themselves via ad arbitrage, the practice of buying web traffic through sponsored posts, hoping clicks to their content will generate enough programmatic ad revenue to make a profit.
- Publishers like CNN, Vox, Huffington Post, and countless others have a hard time saying no to platforms like Taboola, as few want to turn down the revenue.
- Many of these publishers—including Elite Herald and The Magellan Times, which are operated by [Battery Media Group](https://www.batterymediagroup.com)— are owned by Perion, a publicly traded Israeli ad-tech company.
	- Perion made [$109 million in Q2-21](https://wp-cdn.perion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03105145/PERI_Q2_2021-final.pdf) and is on pace to make $430 million this year.
- According to [EliteHerald’s ads.txt file](https://eliteherald.com/ads.txt), which lets you see which ad tech firms a publisher works with, PubMatic is among the list of supply-side platforms bringing ads to Eliteherald.com.
	- When Marketing Brew asked PubMatic why Elite Herald appeared on its platform, it said “this site does not meet our quality bar and we have therefore stopped monetizing it.”
		- *“Enforcement of this policy can’t be done without deeper investigation as no algorithm can do it. PubMatic regularly reviews and removes sites whose quality signals indicate that additional scrutiny is warranted...Additionally, buyers receive full reporting on every site they are buying from the PubMatic platform, and if they find the site objectionable, they can add it to their exclusion list to avoid further exposure.”*
	- Similarly, Google’s [ad placement policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1346295?hl=en) explicitly forbid “pages with more advertising than publisher-provided content.”
- Jill Casey is director of publisher platform partnerships at Xandr, which operates both a supply-side and demand-side platform, and can be found on the ads.txt of many of these sites. Casey said it’s not a supply-side platform’s place to determine publisher quality.
	- “We try to stay sort of agnostic to what people on the internet might like to read. Brands may not want to think that’s where people are, but a lot of the internet is celebrity gossip and things that feel clickbaity...Consumers keep these sites alive, and brands want to be cost effective, so they go there.”
- Others don’t see it that way. Joshua Lowcock, EVP and chief digital officer at media agency UM, said, “The supply side of the ad tech ecosystem has been incredibly poor at vetting sites. Every site they reject reduces the potential income stream to themselves. So they are in effect incentivized to continue adding inventory. My clients are being forced to pay for lazy, slipshod incompetence from others.”
