- The cookie ecosystem (still around but not for much longer) puts quality brand ads on the long tail of small sites, but also on worthless or clickbait sites.
- **“Made for advertising”** sites, which flourish via platforms like Taboola and Outbrain, basically exist to grab ad dollars.
- Using content recommendation platforms like Taboola or Outbrain, these publishers place ads on legitimate news sources like USA Today, goading people with patently ridiculous headlines to click through to their sites.
- While browsing some of these clickbait sites, which have names like Adventure Crunch and It’s The Vibe, Marketing Brew found ads for Nike, CVS, Disney, JetBlue, Best Buy, and other blue-chip brands.
- This type of inventory is snapping up as much as 12.3% of global programmatic web display ad spend, according to Jounce Media, which reviewed spending on more than 2,000 sites it labeled as “made for advertising.”
- The ecosystem of spray-and-pray programmatic advertising may result in billions of dollars directed away from publishers that offer more traditionally vetted news toward a Wild West of crap content.
	- “It checks all the boxes that the industry cares about. It’s not fraud, it’s brand safe. It’s viewable, and it’s cheap.”
- Sites like The Magellan Times sustain themselves via ad arbitrage, the practice of buying web traffic through sponsored posts, hoping clicks to their content will generate enough programmatic ad revenue to make a profit.
