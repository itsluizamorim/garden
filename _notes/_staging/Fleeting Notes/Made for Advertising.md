- **“Made for advertising”** sites, which flourish via platforms like Taboola and Outbrain, basically exist to grab ad dollars. Brands are still playing ball with clickbait ad sites, advertising’s roach that will survive the bomb.
- Using content recommendation platforms like Taboola or Outbrain, these publishers place ads on legitimate news sources like USA Today, goading people with patently ridiculous headlines to click through to their sites.
- This type of inventory is snapping up as much as 12.3% of global programmatic web display ad spend, according to Jounce Media, which reviewed spending on more than 2,000 sites it labeled as “made for advertising.”
	- According to eMarketer estimates, programmatic digital display ad spending will surpass $115 billion in the US alone next year. That means billions of programmatic ad dollars are spent on sites like Magellantimes.com, Itsthevibe.com, and Adventurecrunch.com.
- So, how did Advertisers end up on this site? The ecosystem of spray-and-pray programmatic advertising may result in billions of dollars directed away from publishers that offer more traditionally vetted news toward a Wild West of crap content.
- Chris Kane, founder and president of Jounce Media, said this type of inventory often meets “minimum standards” for advertisers, low as they may be. “It checks all the boxes that the industry cares about. It’s not fraud, it’s brand safe. It’s viewable, and it’s cheap.”
- Sites like The Magellan Times sustain themselves via what some in the industry refer to as ad arbitrage, the practice of buying web traffic through sponsored posts, hoping clicks to their content will generate enough programmatic ad revenue to make a profit.
