#### Problem Solving Module
-   High School Level Math
-   Analyze Data
-   Reasoning Skills =! Not a Math test

Tip-off: Sometimes you can use non-standard math techniques to get the right answer.

Pavlov Response/Classical Conditioning: recognize common patterns and question types so that you know to begin as soon as you look at the problem.

Practice, practice, practice…

**Five Strategies for Problem Solving:**
1.  Working Backwards
2.  Making up numbers
3.  WIBNI
4.  Approximating
5.  Elimination & Guessing

#1: Working Backwards:
Difficult: Easy
  
When:
1.  The multiple choices answers are all numbers **AND** 
2.  The question asks for a single, unadultered value in isolation (e.g., what’s the fraction?).  
  

**How:**

1.  Assume the answer is “C”
2.  Work the problem backwards using the value in the answer “C” to see if it works

a. If it works… your answer is C

b. If it doesn’t work… eliminate three answers **AND** test one remaining option.

  

  

S2: Make Up Numbers:  

  

Difficult: Medium  

  

Make problemas involving variables less esoteric and more easier.

  

**When:**

1.  There are variable in the question and answer choices **OR**
2.  The answer depends on some value not given in the question

  

**How #1:**

1.  Make up numbers to the variables

1.  Choose easy numbers
2.  Avoid 0, 1, and numbers in the question
3.  If a conversion will be required (e.g., seconds to minutes) choose 2x the conversion factor (e.g., let “S” = 120)

3.  Work the problem using our made up numbers.
4.  Plug our numbers into the answer and see what matches our previous result.

  

**How #2**

1.  Make up number for the missing value

1.  If the question contains fraction choose LCD
2.  If the question contains %, choose 100

  

S3: WIBNI: Wouldn’t it be nice if…?

  

Difficult: Complex

  

Solve an **easier version** of a hard question **to discover the rule/code** that would allow us to solve the harder one.

  

1.  It’s a mindset!
2.  Think about wouldn’t it be nice if…   
    

  

  

S4: Approximation:

  

Difficult: HARD

  

**When:**

When you see “approximately” or “closest to” in the question. 

  

**How:** 

Round numbers to avoid unnecessary multiplication or division.

  

  

S5: Elimination & Guessing

  

If you must guess..

a. Eliminate an answer tha looks different from the others

b. Eliminate outlier / extrema answer choices

c. Eliminate answers that are the same as numbers used in the problem (catch-eyes!) 

  

  

**## MATH REVIEW ##**

**Percents, Fractions, Decimals**

Different ways to express the same thing

  

Formula: %/100 = part/whole

  

Work backwards.

  

Tip: Think about tipping your waiter to solve %!!!

  

Add Fractions: The “magic X”

  

Percents increase/decrease

  

  

%Change = Net Value/Orig. Value x 100

  

  

Calculate percentage:

1.  Translate to decimals
2.  Move the decimal point to the end
3.  Calculate the multiplication 
4.  Move back the decimal point in the result

  

  

**EA Data Sufficiency Module**  

  

Think of Data Sufficiency questions as “reverse” word problems.

  

How it works:

1.  They ask the question
2.  They give the facts
3.  You have do decide if you’re able to answer the question

  

_Note: we may or may not have been given enough information to answer the question!_

  

**Main strategy:** Ask yourself, “Could a Harvard math professor with a calculator answer the question based on the information given?”

  

Important:

1.  You DON’T have to solve the problem!
2.  You just need to determine wheter you could. 

  

Your objective is to determine wheter the statements (in the question), either individually or together, give you enough information to answer the question. 

  

Memory Trick:  

A. 1 alone

B. 2 alone

C. Need Both

D. Either is sufficient (Each by themselves)

E. Neither of them (Need more info)

  

_Nuance for D: your answer will be D only when both statements produce the same answer._

  

Elimination:

-   **Scenario #1:** You determine that statement 1 is sufficient. You can eliminate B (2 alone), C (Need both), and E (Neither of them).  
    
-   **Scenario #2:** You aren’t sure about 1, but you determine that 2 is sufficient. You can eliminate A (1 alone), C (Need both), and E (Neither of them).
-   **Scenario #3:** You determine that statement 1 isn’t sufficient. You can eliminate A (1 alone), and D (Each by themselves).
-   **Scenario #4:** You determine that statement 2 isn’t sufficient. You can eliminate B (2 alone), and D (Each by themselves).

  

Step by step:

1.  Read the question and pre-think about what would you need to answer it. 
2.  Evaluate one statement in isolation.
3.  Evaluate the other statement in isolation.
4.  (If needed) Evaluate both statements together.

  

_Caveat: start with the statement if you find it’s easier, but do it in isolation._ 

Your job is to be the JUDGE and not the JURY!

  

  

**TIP:** Don’t make snap decisions. On harder problems, “chase it down the rabbit hole” to prove (or disprove) sufficiency.

  

Variables:

-   Make up Numbers!  
    
-   Remember: Variables can stand for ANY number.
-   Test the **FONZI**:

-   **F**ractions
-   **O**ne
-   **N**egative #’s
-   **Z**ero
-   **I**ntegers

  

_Remember: Variables can be the same number._

  

Relationships:

#1: Relationships doesn’t equal quantities. 

#2 given two quantities, X and Y, knowing anyone of the following relationship is sufficient to find the other two relationships:

-   X is a certain fraction of Y
-   X is a certain percentage of Y
-   The ratio of X:Y

#3 Relationships enable us to determine relative size.

  

Integers:

  

An integer is a whole number (i.e., a number that is not a fraction). An integer may be positive, negative, or the number zero.

  

If X/M and X/N are integers where both M and N are integers, then X is a multiple of M*N.

  

**MAKE UP NUMBERS**

  

Yes/No Questions:

  

Lots of Data Sufficiency questions are YES/NO questions. They can be tricky if you don’t think about them correctly. 

  

Be careful: even if a statement leads you to conclude the answer to the question is “NO”, the very fact that you can answer “NO” means that you are given enough information to answer the question! Therefore, the statement is SUFFICIENT.

  

Both or Neither:

  

Elimination Tip: if both statements give roughly the same type of information, the answer is probably D or E.

-   “Both or Neither” realization can improve your guessing odds.

  

A statement is more likely to be sufficient if:

1.  It provides specific numerical values not given in the premise.  
    
2.  It adds something new to the premise.

  

**EA Sentence Correction Module**  

  

Test your ability to identify correct and effective English expression. 

-   Correct = grammatically correct
-   Effective = best way to say something

  

Structure = Sentence, part of which is underlined. 

  

**## STEP-BY-STEP ##**

1.  Read the original sentence and try to identify an error BEFORE looking at the answer choices - Pre-think!
2.  If there is an error or the sentence is confusing, eliminate answer choice A.
3.  If an error is detected, eliminate any answer choice that doesn’t make the necessary correction. 

1.  If you saw more than one mistake, deal with each one-by-one. 
2.  make sure you’re confident before eliminating an answer choice. 

5.  If more than one answer choice remains, or if no mistake was detected to begin with:

1.  Go through your checklist of common grammar mistakes.
2.  Consider effectiveness rules.
3.  Look to the answer choices for clues; run the differences through your grammar checklist.

7.  After going through the checklist in the Step 4, if you still don’t detect a mistake in the original sentence, choose answer choice A. 

  

Grammar Checklist:

[ ] Subject-Verb Agreement

[ ] Pronouns  

[ ] Modifiers  

[ ] Parallelism  

[ ] Idioms  

[ ] Comparisons  

[ ] Verb Tenses  

  

Misc Considerations:  

-   Answer choice A: No error. 1/6 of the time. Don’t assume the setence is correct before going through the step-by-step and your checklist. 
    
-   Sentence correction isn’t a democracy! Beware of the "majority rule”.  
    
-   A correct answer cannot change the meaning of the sentence. Beware the change of location of adjectives and adverbs.
-   Beware of relying solely on your “ear”!!  
    
-   A correct sentence can’t not be correct if there is a grammar mistake in it. Use your grammar checklist.

  

Effectiveness Rules:

These rules can:

-   Help you choose the best answer among two or more “good” answers;
-   Help you guess;
-   Help you identify wrong answers;

  

Rules:

1.  **Shorter is better**; When is doubt, choose the shorter answer choice;
2.  **Gerunds are bad**! Esp “Being”, which almost always appears in wrong answer choices. Gerunds make a sentence wordy;
3.  **Active voice** is preferrable to Passive voice;
4.  Avoid wordiness and redundancy;

  

_Instead of… | …simple say_

-   Because of the fact that | Because  
    
-   Ask a question whether | Ask whether
-   is cause of | causes
-   Reach a conclusion | conclude

  

Attention: Misplaced Modifier. What is it? How to identify and fix?  

  

Bracketing Technique:

  

Simple grammar error are often camouflaged to make them difficult to spot.   

  

WHEN:

-   Subject-verb agreement
-   Pronoun agreement
-   Idioms

  

HOW: Read around potentially distracting phrases by mentally enclosing them in brackets. 

  

1.  Bracket out:

1.  Prepositional phrases (e.g., of, in, to, for, by, and with)
2.  clauses set off by commas

3.  Re-write the pared-down sentence on your scratch paper and look for errors.

  

_Wrong Example:_ “The degree… were… incredibly small” | Subject + Verb + Object | I + Like + Cake Version of the sentence.

  

Note: if you don’t find an error outside the brackets, then examine the words within the brackets.

  

Subject-Verb agreement:

  

3.  **Subjects and Verbs must always agree**. Remember the basic parts of a sentence.
4.  Joining a singular subject with another noun or pronoun by prepositions such as “along with”, “together with”, “with”, “as well as”, “in addition to”, or “accompanied by” does not make the singular subject a plural one. 

1.  EXCEPT when the singular subject is joined to another noun or pronoun by the word “and” 

6.  When two words or phrases are joined by “either… or”,  ﻿”neither… nor”, or “not only… but also”, the number of the word or phrase nearer to the verb (i.e., the 2nd one) determines the number of the verb.

  
  

Singular | Plural   

-   normal nouns add -s | chair → chairs
-   ends in -on, change to -a | criterion → criteria
-   ends in -is, change to -es | thesis → theses
-   ends in -us, change to -i | cactus → cacti

  

Always singular: everyone/everybody, anyone/anybody, no one/nobody, someone/somebody, each, either/ neither.

Always plural: both, few, many, several.

Depends on the noun to which it refers: some, more, most, all, none, any (e.g., most of the class vs. most of the students).

  

Pronouns:

  

A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun (i.e., person, place, or thing).

  

1.  Pronouns must be in the correct case.

1.  I + Like + Cake: “[Subject pronoun] + Like + [Object Pronoun]”
2.  Subject pronouns: I, you, he/she, we, they, it, who;
3.  Object pronouns: me, you, him/her, us, them, it, whom;
4.  Possessive pronouns: mine, yours, his/hers, ours, their, its, whose;
5.  Always use a subject pronoun after the verb “to be” (e.g., is, are, was, will be, etc.)
6.  Use a subject pronoun in comparisons following the words than or as.

3.  Pronouns must agree in number and case to the word(s) to which they refer.
4.  Pronouns must clearly refer to a noun or to another pronoun without confusion or ambiguity.

1.  A correct choice will usually clear up the pronoun ambiguity.

  

Modifiers:

  

A modifier is simply a word or phrase that qualifies, or gives additional information about, another word.

  

_Example:_

The man likes the woman from Florida.

  

Who is from Florida? The woman. 

  

From Florida = Modifier — gives additional information about the woman.

  

The man from Florida likes the woman.

  

Who is from Florida? The man. 

  

**Key takeaway:** the placement of modifiers matters!

  

Rules:

1.  Place modifiers as close as possible to the word(s) they modify.
2.  If a sentence starts with an action (or description), place the actor (or what is being described) immediately after the comma. 

  

_Wrong example, rule 2:_ “After rotting in the cellar for weeks, my brother finally threw away the oranges.

→ This misplaced modifier creates the impression that “my brother” was rotting in the cellar.

→ Sometimes this type of sentences will require passive voice, but, depending on what’s underlined in the question stem, the correct answer choice can also be in passive voice. 

→ _Misplaced Modifiers:_ When the modifier is in the wrong place. Duh! It’s that simple!  

  

Which vs. That vs. Present Participle  

  

When modifying a noun, we often use a relative pronoun such as:  

-   Which — modifies things
-   That — modifies things
-   Who/Whom — modify people

-   Who acts as the subject of the verb; whom is used as the object of the verb.

-   Whose — modifies people or things
-   Where — modifies place
-   When — modifies an event or time

  

  

Key takeaway for Which vs. That comes down to whether or not the modifier information is essential or non-essential.  

  

-   “Essential” modifiers provide necessary information.

-   Use “that” if the modifier IS essential.

-   Do NOT use commas between essential modifiers and their nouns.

-   “Non-essential” modifiers provide extra information.

-   Use “which” if the modifier is NON-essential.

-   DO use commas between non-essential modifiers and their nouns.

  

The which/that differentiation is unlikely to be the sole deciding issue for an answer choice. However, there IS an important “which” vs. Present Participle differentiation you need to know for harder questions.

  

Advanced “Which” Concept:

IMPORTANT: Use “Which” to modify only the noun immediatly preceding it (i.e., the word(s) right before the comma), not to refer to an entire clause.

  

Fixes when “which” is being used to an entire clause:

1.  Turn the first thought into a noun phrase.
2.  Restate the thought and use “That”.
3.  Get rid of “which” and use the Present Participle (-ing verb form).

  

-   WRONG: “Our air conditioning broke on the hottest day of the summer, which caused us a great deal of discomfort.”  
    
-   RIGHT: "Our air conditioning broke on the hottest day of the summer, causing us a great deal of discomfort."  
    

  

Review: Gerund vs. Present Participle

-   Gerund acts as a noun. Think of gerund as an activity (e.g., Traveling can be expensive)  
    
-   Present Participle acts as verb tenses or adjectives. (e.g., Carol is traveling to Austria)

  

Parallelism:  

  

When two or more things or ideas are being listed, they must be introduced in the same grammatical form for consistency. 

  

Tip-off: A comma followed by “and”. Sometimes you have a list inside another list.

  

Look for errors in several constructions:

-   Lists (grammatical forms)
-   Multiple phrases about the same things
-   Phrase idioms (esp. not only… but also)
