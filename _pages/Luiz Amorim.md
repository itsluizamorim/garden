Howdy!

My name is Luiz Amorim and I am from Brazil. I have recently made the Pacific Northwest my home since 2020 and I couldn't be happier with my decision. I am married and have a 1-year-old daughter named Alice who is the light of my life. My family is completed with a small dog named Bruce who is always by our side.

We currently reside in Bellingham, WA and have been exploring all the PNW has to offer. From the beautiful beaches to the lush forests, we are constantly in awe of the natural beauty this region has to offer.

I am excited to share my experiences and adventures in the PNW with you through this journal. From the best hiking trails to the best places to eat, I hope to give you a glimpse into our new home and all it has to offer. Thank you for following along on our journey!

LA.
