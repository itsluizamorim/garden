# My Cascadia Journal 🌲
`A personal blog by Luiz Amorim.` 

<<<<<<< HEAD
Hi there! I'm [[Luiz Amorim]], and I'm currently exploring the beauty of the [[Pacific Northwest]] with my family - from the sparkling waters of [[Bellingham Bay]] to the lush forests of the Chuckanut Mountains.

Hi there! I'm [Luiz Amorim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luizamorim/), and you’ve stumbled upon my personal blog. ☺️

This site is a spot for me to put everything else, should I choose. I don’t expect to post here very frequently, but I want it to exist.
