# My Cascadia Journey 🌲
`A personal blog written by ChatGTP, and edited by Luiz Amorim.` 

Hi there! I'm [Luiz Amorim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luizamorim/), and I'm currently exploring the beauty of the [[Pacific Northwest]] - from the sparkling waters of [[Bellingham Bay]] to the lush forests of the Chuckanut Mountains.

📍 Bellingham, WA (via 🇧🇷)
